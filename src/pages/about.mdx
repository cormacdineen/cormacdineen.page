## About me

I'm Cormac Dineen, I'm a full-time PhD student at the University of Bath investigating new quantitative approaches to uncertainty analysis for carbon footprinting and LCA. Prior to that I spend 7 years as a Sustainability Consultant working with companies to measure and report on their climate impacts.

I'm mainly using this site to post about my [research](https://orcid.org/0009-0006-5969-2226). However, with attention spans in retreat and complexity of published works on the march, I thought it would be a useful exercise to summarise some of my work more plainly here. I also hope to write short pieces about anything that interests me.
Outside of work, I maintain loose levels of commitment to a variety of things, such as sport, reading, and listening to music. I'll be posting about my Cultural Stew (anything I've watched, read or tried and felt like recommending or pillorying). I've also started taking photos more consistantly, and will post them here too.

## Research interests

- Uncertainty associated with material provenence in complex supply chains
- Bayesian inference and combining top down and bottom up carbon data to quantify uncertainty
- Python and AI for research

## Public service announcement

The words on this site will always be 100% free of AI slop (although AI will help me develop and maintain the site itself.)
